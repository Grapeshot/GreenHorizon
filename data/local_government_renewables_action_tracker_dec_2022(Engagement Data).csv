In particular, the City of Raleigh submitted additional comments to urge NCUC to hold Duke Energy accountable in the integrated resource planning process to make the net-zero goal viable. This joint letter marked a collective effort to put priority on energy transition and demonstrate collaborative leadership to both North Carolinians and the nation.
